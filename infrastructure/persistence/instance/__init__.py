"""Per-instance DB layer.

Splits each instance's persistence into 4 .db files by purpose:
vitals / memory / runtime_log / workflow. Old single-file
``apps/<id>/data/state.db`` keeps running until callers migrate.

Modules in this package create and own SQLite connections for one
instance. Domain code should depend on per-area ports (in
``domain/persistence``) and not on the concrete SQLite classes here.

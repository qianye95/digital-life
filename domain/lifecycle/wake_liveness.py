"""Wake liveness evaluation for the stale-RUNNING recovery path.

The cron tick (``cron_lifecycle._run_l4_tick_inner``) and the process-startup
cleanup (``server._cleanup_stale_affair_on_startup``) both need to answer one
question when an affair is marked ``RUNNING``:

    *Is the wake behind this affair actually still doing useful work, or has it
    died without rolling back?*

The historical signal — ``affairs.updated_at`` freshness — is wrong for this
purpose: ``updated_at`` is refreshed only when the affair **changes state**, and
a wake sets ``RUNNING`` once at start (``scheduler.py``) and never touches the
row again while running. A legitimate 20-minute LLM task therefore looks
"stale" after 5 minutes, and the old hard-coded 300 s check rolled it back to
``BLOCKED`` — which in turn made ``_wake_or_inject`` dispatch a **new** wake
(instead of injecting mid-session) when fresh events arrived. That is the root
cause of the alpha "wake #1181 still running but #1182 fired" defect.

This module replaces that signal with two independent evidence sources and a
single shared threshold:

1. ``_wake_in_progress[instance_id]`` — the in-process module-level flag set in
   ``wake_digital_life`` while the wake holds the instance lock. Authoritative
   but **process-local**: invisible to other instance subprocesses and empty
   right after a restart.
2. ``RuntimeLogDB.last_turn_at()`` — the most recent ``turn`` row timestamp.
   The agent writes one or more turn rows per LLM call, so this is a fine-
   grained, durable "the model is still emitting" heartbeat that survives
   process restarts.

A wake is considered alive if *either* signal is recent enough. Only when both
say "dead" does the caller roll back the affair — and the threshold is shared
with the scheduler zombie-lock guard so the two never disagree.

    Returns ``(was_alive, reason, signals)`` where ``signals`` captures the raw
    evidence for structured logging at every call site.

    Decision (strongest live signal wins):

    1. ``_wake_in_progress[instance_id]`` is set
       → alive. Fast in-process path; the wake thread is holding the lock.
    2. ``audit.last_turn_at()`` is within ``stale_threshold_s``
       → alive. Turn heartbeat says the model is still producing turns. This is
       the cross-process / post-restart fallback.
    3. No turn yet, but the most recent wake started within ``stale_threshold_s``
       → alive. Startup window: a brand-new wake has not landed its first turn.
    4. Otherwise → not alive. Caller may roll the affair back to ``BLOCKED``.

    ``stale_threshold_s`` defaults to :data:`STALE_RUNNING_SECONDS` so every
    caller uses the same knob. ``now`` is injectable for deterministic tests.

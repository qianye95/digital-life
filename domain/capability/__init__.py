"""Self-registered tool/skill capability system.

Public API — callers (interfaces/tools/capability_tools.py, scheduler,
frontend) interact through this package, not the internal modules.

Layers:
  paths.py   — scope → directory resolution (pure, no IO)
  store.py   — manifest.json CRD (metadata only, no business logic)
  lifecycle.py — full registration lifecycle (safety → write → store → hot-load)
